// You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums, where nums[i] represents the score of the ith student. You are also given an integer k.

// Pick the scores of any k students from the array so that the difference between the highest and the lowest of the k scores is minimized.

// Return the minimum possible difference.

 

// Example 1:

// Input: nums = [90], k = 1
// Output: 0
// Explanation: There is one way to pick score(s) of one student:
// - [90]. The difference between the highest and lowest score is 90 - 90 = 0.
// The minimum possible difference is 0.
// Example 2:

// Input: nums = [9,4,1,7], k = 2
// Output: 2
// Explanation: There are six ways to pick score(s) of two students:
// - [9,4,1,7]. The difference between the highest and lowest score is 9 - 4 = 5.
// - [9,4,1,7]. The difference between the highest and lowest score is 9 - 1 = 8.
// - [9,4,1,7]. The difference between the highest and lowest score is 9 - 7 = 2.
// - [9,4,1,7]. The difference between the highest and lowest score is 4 - 1 = 3.
// - [9,4,1,7]. The difference between the highest and lowest score is 7 - 4 = 3.
// - [9,4,1,7]. The difference between the highest and lowest score is 7 - 1 = 6.
// The minimum possible difference is 2.
