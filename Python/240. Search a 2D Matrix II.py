# Write an efficient algorithm that searches for a value target in an m x n integer matrix matrix. This matrix has the following properties:

# Integers in each row are sorted in ascending from left to right.
# Integers in each column are sorted in ascending from top to bottom.
 

# Example 1:


# Input: matrix = [[1,4,7,11,15],[2,5,8,12,19],[3,6,9,16,22],[10,13,14,17,24],[18,21,23,26,30]], target = 5
# Output: true
# Example 2:


# Input: matrix = [[1,4,7,11,15],[2,5,8,12,19],[3,6,9,16,22],[10,13,14,17,24],[18,21,23,26,30]], target = 20
# Output: false

class Solution(object):
    def searchMatrix(self, matrix, target):
        m = len(matrix)
        n = len(matrix[0])
        i = m - 1
        j = 0
        while i >= 0 and j < n:
            if matrix[i][j] == target:
                return True
            elif matrix[i][j] > target:
                i -= 1
            else:
                j += 1
        return False
