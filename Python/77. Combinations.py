# Given two integers n and k, return all possible combinations of k numbers chosen from the range [1, n].

# You may return the answer in any order.

 

# Example 1:

# Input: n = 4, k = 2
# Output: [[1,2],[1,3],[1,4],[2,3],[2,4],[3,4]]
# Explanation: There are 4 choose 2 = 6 total combinations.
# Note that combinations are unordered, i.e., [1,2] and [2,1] are considered to be the same combination.
# Example 2:

# Input: n = 1, k = 1
# Output: [[1]]
# Explanation: There is 1 choose 1 = 1 total combination.
