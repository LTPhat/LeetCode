# Given the head of a singly linked list, reverse the list, and return the reversed list.

 

# Example 1:


# Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5]
# Output: [5,4,3,2,1]
# Example 2:


# Input: head = [1,2]
# Output: [2,1]
# Example 3:

# Input: head = []
# Output: []
 

# Constraints:

# The number of nodes in the list is the range [0, 5000].
# -5000 <= Node.val <= 5000
