# You are given an array of strings names, and an array heights that consists of distinct positive integers. Both arrays are of length n.

# For each index i, names[i] and heights[i] denote the name and height of the ith person.

# Return names sorted in descending order by the people's heights.

 

# Example 1:

# Input: names = ["Mary","John","Emma"], heights = [180,165,170]
# Output: ["Mary","Emma","John"]
# Explanation: Mary is the tallest, followed by Emma and John.
# Example 2:

# Input: names = ["Alice","Bob","Bob"], heights = [155,185,150]
# Output: ["Bob","Alice","Bob"]
# Explanation: The first Bob is the tallest, followed by Alice and the second Bob.
 

# Constraints:

# n == names.length == heights.length
# 1 <= n <= 103
# 1 <= names[i].length <= 20
# 1 <= heights[i] <= 105
# names[i] consists of lower and upper case English letters.
# All the values of heights are distinct.
