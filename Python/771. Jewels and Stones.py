# You're given strings jewels representing the types of stones that are jewels, and stones representing the stones you have. Each character in stones is a type of stone you have. You want to know how many of the stones you have are also jewels.

# Letters are case sensitive, so "a" is considered a different type of stone from "A".

 

# Example 1:

# Input: jewels = "aA", stones = "aAAbbbb"
# Output: 3
# Example 2:

# Input: jewels = "z", stones = "ZZ"
# Output: 0
 

# Constraints:

# 1 <= jewels.length, stones.length <= 50
# jewels and stones consist of only English letters.
# All the characters of jewels are unique.
